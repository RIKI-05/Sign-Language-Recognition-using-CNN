Communication plays a vital role in sharing information, ideas, and feelings between 
individuals. However, communication barriers arise when individuals have different 
languages or face challenges such as deafness and muteness. Deafness refers to the 
inability to hear, while muteness refers to the inability to speak. Deaf and dumb 
individuals communicate through sign language, a visual and gestural system. 
Unfortunately, not everyone can understand of sign language, hindering effective 
communication between deaf and dumb individuals and the general population.
To address this communication gap, machine learning-based models can be developed. 
These models can be trained to recognize and interpret different sign language 
gestures, facilitating real-time translation into spoken or written language. This 
advancement would greatly assist in bridging the communication gap between normal 
individuals and the deaf and dumb community.
This report focuses on the development of a real-time Sign Language Recognition 
system using transfer learning and machine learning techniques. The proposed 
methodology involves creating an American Sign Language dataset using a webcam, 
followed by training a TensorFlow model using transfer learning. Transfer learning 
allows leveraging pre-trained models to expedite the training process and achieve 
higher accuracy. The system aims to provide accurate recognition of American Sign 
Language gestures in real-time.
The evaluation of the system demonstrates promising results, achieving an accuracy 
level of 94%. This indicates the system's ability to effectively recognize and interpret 
sign language gestures, facilitating communication between deaf and dumb 
individuals and the general population. The real-time nature of the system enhances 
its usability and practicality in various scenarios, such as educational settings, social 
interactions, and public services.
By utilizing machine learning and transfer learning techniques, this research 
contributes to the field of Sign Language Recognition, addressing the challenges faced 
by the deaf and dumb community. The proposed system has the potential to enhance 
inclusivity, promote effective communication, and empower individuals with hearing 
and speech impairments.
